# üì∏ Smart Photo Storage

**Smart Photo Storage** is a personal flagship project aimed at building a modern, intelligent photo management application. Unlike basic cloud storage apps, this system not only stores and organizes your photos but also uses machine learning to make them searchable through natural language queries like `"family beach"` or `"birthday at night"`.

This project is designed to showcase real-world engineering skills across backend development, machine learning integration, and scalable architecture ‚Äî built to reflect production-quality complexity while still being achievable as a solo developer.

## ‚ú® Key Features (Planned)

- Secure photo upload and local disk storage
- Web-based gallery for browsing photos
- Natural language photo search using image embeddings
- External ML inference service for semantic understanding
- Asynchronous photo processing using message brokers
- Containerized architecture with Docker
- Designed to be self-hostable and cloud-agnostic

## üìå Project Goals

- ‚úÖ Build a full-stack product from scratch
- ‚úÖ Apply modern software engineering practices
- ‚úÖ Integrate machine learning into a real-world app
- ‚úÖ Design a modular, scalable architecture
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate practical system design and implementation skills

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### Phase 1 ‚Äì MVP
- [ ] Backend API in Go for photo upload and metadata handling
- [ ] Frontend in Vue.js for image browsing and upload
- [ ] Store metadata (e.g., upload time, tags) in MongoDB
- [ ] Save image files to local disk (`/uploads`)
- [ ] Dockerized backend and frontend services

### Phase 2 ‚Äì ML Integration
- [ ] Create external FastAPI service for image embedding (CLIP/BLIP)
- [ ] Call inference service from backend after upload
- [ ] Store image embeddings (as float arrays) in MongoDB
- [ ] Implement basic semantic search using cosine similarity

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Asynchronous Architecture
- [ ] Add message broker (RabbitMQ)
- [ ] Queue image embedding jobs on upload
- [ ] Create ML worker service to process embedding tasks asynchronously
- [ ] Move toward a loosely coupled, production-like system

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Polish and Deploy
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or similar)
- [ ] Setup local deployment with Docker Compose
- [ ] Record demo video, write technical blog post
- [ ] Finalize documentation and diagrams

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Storage and Search Optimization
- [ ] Migrate image storage to MinIO (S3-compatible)
- [ ] Move vector data from MongoDB to Qdrant or Weaviate
- [ ] Integrate vector DB for fast and scalable semantic search
