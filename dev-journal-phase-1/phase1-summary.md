# 📦 Phase 1 Summary – Smart Photo Storage


## ✅ What’s Been Achieved (MVP)

- **Backend (Go + Gin)**:
  - User registration and login with JWT-based authentication
  - Upload photos (single and batch) and store them in local disk
  - Metadata (filename, date, etc.) stored in MongoDB
  - Search and pagination support via REST API
  - Basic CORS and JWT middleware implemented

- **Frontend (Vue + Tailwind CSS)**:
  - Landing page with dark-themed layout and app overview
  - Pages for Login, Register, Gallery, and Photo Upload
  - Connected to backend using `.env` configuration
  - Stores JWT in `localStorage` for API requests

- **Containerization (Docker)**:
  - Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend
  - `.env` support for configuration
  - Works properly with Docker network for local development


## 🛤️ What’s Next (Phase 2+)

- 🎯 **ML Integration** with CLIP/BLIP via FastAPI inference service
- 🔁 **Asynchronous processing** with RabbitMQ
- 🧠 **Semantic search** with vector embeddings
- ☁️ **MinIO integration** for scalable image storage
- 🚀 **CI/CD & deployment polish** via GitHub Actions


---

📌 **Phase 1 is complete.** The system now supports end-to-end photo upload, storage, viewing, and basic search—all within a clean full-stack architecture that’s ready to scale.
