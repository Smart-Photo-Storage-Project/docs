## âœ… Progress

- Initialized Vue JS project that use Tailwind CSS
- Designed the landing page with a proper layout:
  - Dark-themed navigation bar
  - Hero section with headline and call-to-action
  - Application description section (what the app does)
  - Motivation section (hard to find old photos in large libraries)
  - Footer section (developer information)
- Set up `vue-router` and confirmed routing works properly
- Created a  **Login page** and a **Register Page**
- Implemented working navigation between Home, Login, and Register pages
- Fixed UI issues related to spacing, alignment, and horizontal overflow
- Button actions (e.g., Get Started, Back to Home) now correctly link to their respective routes

## ðŸ§© Challenges

- Faced layout alignment issues and spacing problems with Tailwind classes (e.g., `mb`, `py`, `min-h-screen`)
- Unfamiliarity with Vue 3 syntax and component structure slowed initial progress


## ðŸ”œ Next Up

- Design and implement the **Photo Viewer** and **Photo Upload** pages
- Begin integrating frontend with backend APIs (login, register, upload)
- Implement frontend authentication flow (token handling, route protection)
- Display photo gallery using data fetched from backend
