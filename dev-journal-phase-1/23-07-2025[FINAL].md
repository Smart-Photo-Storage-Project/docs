# ðŸ“… Dev Journal â€“ 2025-07-20

## âœ… Progress

- Finalized Docker setup for both backend (Go) and frontend (Vue)
- Fixed CORS and backend API base URL in frontend using `.env` files
- Ensured `.env` files are excluded from Git with `.gitignore`
- Tested login, register, and photo upload flows successfully in containerized environment
- Marked the completion of **Phase 1 (MVP)** ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ§© Challenges

- Docker networking: needed specific url to access host services from containers (MongoDB, backend)
- `.env` handling: Vue requires `VITE_` prefix for custom environment variables
- Accidentally committed sensitive `.env` file before `.gitignore` was in place

## ðŸ”œ Next Up

- Start **Phase 2 â€“ ML Integration**:
  - Set up FastAPI inference service with CLIP or BLIP for image embeddings
  - Add backend logic to send uploaded images to inference service
  - Store generated embeddings alongside metadata in MongoDB
- Implement semantic search endpoint using cosine similarity
- Continue documenting architecture and decisions
