## âœ… Progress

- Migrated image embedding flow to **asynchronous architecture** using **RabbitMQ**:
  - Backend no longer calls inference service directly after upload
  - Instead, it **publishes a message** to RabbitMQ with metadata and image path
  - Inference service now runs a **background consumer** that listens for new image embedding tasks


- Verified entire flow:
  - Upload image â†’ backend stores metadata â†’ inference service embeds + stores to Qdrant

## ðŸ”œ Next Up

- Implement **MinIO** for storing image files instead of local disk:
  - Backend will upload to MinIO
  - Inference will fetch using signed URLs or internal MinIO client
- Refactor codebase to improve maintainability:
  - Break long methods into smaller units
  - Enforce clearer separation of concerns (e.g., RabbitMQ handling, embedding logic)
- Adopt Go's `context` package in backend:
  - Ensure external calls (MinIO, RabbitMQ, inference) respect context cancellation
  - Improve observability and timeout handling
- Add **notification system** to inform frontend when embedding and indexing is complete
